## Weather:

Users may view the weather from each park and change temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius. This is done through session ID to keep the changes relative to the person viewing the website.

## Survey:
In addition to a details page and the weather, the user may also fill out a form to indicate their favorite park. Their survey choice is stored inside a SQL database and adds the vote to the vote count already existing. Users can view the page of the ranked results by clicking on the button below the survey fields.
